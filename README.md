### What are Objects

Objects are core data structure in JavaScript. They help us tyoically reflect "real-world" entities. Objects are made up of properties and methods. We store data in properties and actions in methods. Objects allow us to group related data together and split your code into logical pieces.

In Objects, we have two types of values:
+ Primitive Values: String, Boolean, null, Number, Undefined, Symbol.
+ Reference Values: Objects {...}, Arrays [...], Dom nodes.
